# Unlock-All-Layers-Photoshop-JSX
A simple Photoshop **ExtendScript (JSX)** that unlocks all locked layers and groups in the active document.   This script can convert a Background into a normal layer, detect which layers are actually locked, and only unlock those targets (for speed). It also displays a minimal progress bar while running.
